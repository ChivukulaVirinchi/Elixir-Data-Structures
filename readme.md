# Data Structures and Algorithms in Elixir

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms in Elixir repository! This comprehensive collection showcases various data structures and algorithms implemented in Elixir, a functional programming language known for its conciseness, scalability, and fault-tolerance.

## 🌟 Purpose

This repository serves as a valuable resource for Elixir developers, computer science students, and algorithm enthusiasts. It demonstrates how classic data structures and algorithms can be implemented in a functional programming paradigm, highlighting Elixir's unique features and syntax.

## 🚀 Why Elixir?

Elixir's functional nature, immutability principles, and pattern matching capabilities lead to implementations that are often quite different from their imperative counterparts in languages like Python or JavaScript. This repository aims to bridge that gap, providing clear, idiomatic Elixir solutions for a wide range of DSA problems.

## 📚 Current Implementations

### Sorting Algorithms
1. Quick Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Selection Sort
6. Counting Sort

(More data structures and algorithms will be added in future updates)

## 🔮 Future Additions

We plan to expand this repository to include:

- Data Structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables)
- Search Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming Solutions
- And much more!

## 💡 Key Features of Elixir Implementations

- **Immutability**: All data structures are immutable, leading to creative solutions.
- **Pattern Matching**: Extensive use of Elixir's powerful pattern matching capabilities.
- **Recursion**: Algorithms often leverage recursion, a natural fit for Elixir.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Utilization of Elixir's `Enum` module and other functional programming concepts.
- **Conciseness**: Implementations are often more concise than their imperative counterparts.

## 🔍 How to Use

Each algorithm or data structure is implemented in its own module. For example, to use a sorting algorithm:

```elixir
sorted_list = QuickSort.sort([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])
```
